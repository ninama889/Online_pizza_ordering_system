# Online_pizza_ordering_system

Overview of Project

A customer can view the menu card, select the pizzas of his choice and place an order for home delivery.
While placing the order, a customer needs to enter personal details and the delivery location.
If the mobile number of a customer is already registered with the shop, all the details are automatically fetched. Customer has an option of using the same registered address or entering a new one.
Our system finds the shortest path to the customerâ€™s location and saves this shortest distance.
Customer can confirm his order and pay the bill amount or can cancel the current order.
